# Hello, I'm Michael

I'm passionate about technology, music, and learning!

## About Me
Growing up, there was always something to do around my house. I have three older brothers, one older sister, and two younger brothers. My father immigrated from India when he was 13 years old and met my mother in the U.S. Army.

My siblings and I were all involved with sports: mainly tennis, track, and cross country. We also were involved in a local robotics competition which sparked my interest in mechanical engineering, CAD software, and computer science.

In high school I was involved in 4-H where I created a robotics club which competed at a national level.

Today, I am a student at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. I'm studying computer science with a minor in cybersecurity and mathematics.

In my spare time I like to play tennis, lift weights, practice piano, and make beats on my computer. At Texas A&M I am the treasurer of the Aggie Artifical Intelligence Society, and a member of The 12th Can and Aggie Coding Club.

## Professional

I have been passionate about technology and computers from a young age. My first exposure to computer science concepts came from creating photo-realistic digital renders of LEGO contraptions with POVRay. In middle school, I was programming a LEGO robot for a team which competed both locally and nationally. Around this time, I was also building custom computers for friends and family.

But it wasn’t until high school when I joined an FRC robotics team that I became focused on studying computer science and building my career around it. My robotics team, named The Screaming Chickens, taught me essential skills such as leadership and creative thinking, while also giving me first hand experience with advanced computer science concepts such as PID motor control, computer vision, and human-computer interaction.

The skills and experiences from my robotics team have opened many doors in my professional life. During the summer of my third year of high-school I applied for a software engineering internship at Peloton Technology, an autonomous trucking startup in California. I learned about the company through a family friend, but I also recognized them as a sponsor of a well known FRC robotics team. As a high school student, I was ecstatic at the thought of interning outside of my hometown on an emerging technology. However, I was not prepared for the technical questions that I was asked during the phone interview and I quickly learned that I lacked the experience the company needed for the role. This rejection was a humbling experience to say the least, and I realized that there is always something more to learn about computer science.

A few days later, Peloton reached out to me again saying they needed an IT / Software Support intern. I was thrilled to get the chance for another interview and I was fortunate to be accepted for the role. During my time at Peloton Technology, I was surrounded by extremely talented co-workers who pushed me to raise my goals and ambitions for my own career. I shadowed software engineers while also helping them with questions and issues regarding Linux and enterprise software. During lunch, I would sit with engineers and executives and hear about their life experiences first-hand.

The next summer I joined the first team for a new internship program at NVIDIA in Santa Clara, California. The internship was intended for high school students to create developer resources and use-case examples for the Jetson TX2. My team’s specific project consisted of programming a humanoid robot to use computer vision and machine learning to identify white cups on an office floor. The robot was programmed and trained to approach the cups, pick them up, and place them in a trash can. Video:
During high school, I was a member of FRC Team 3997, The Screaming Chickens.
This team has taught me so much about technology and gave me the chance to give back to my community through outreach events. 

Soon after the internship ended, I began my first semester at Texas A&M. Three of my older siblings had already graduated from A&M, so I felt right at home. I was excited to start this new chapter of my life and learn from industry leaders and professionals in computer science.

The next summer I interned at KBSI (Knowledge Based System Inc.) in College Station, Texas. KBSI specializes in small applied research projects, and my project involved developing human-computer interaction controls in a Virtual Reality world. The summer after, I drove to Santa Barbara, California to intern for Texas Instruments. My work consisted of writing device drivers for the SimpleLink™ SDK.

Today I am starting my third year at Texas A&M and I wouldn’t trade my experience at this university for the world. I’ve made lasting friendships, countless memories, and persevered through challenging experiences. I have been very fortunate to have the opportunities that have been given to me and I am proud that they have shaped me into a life-long learner.
