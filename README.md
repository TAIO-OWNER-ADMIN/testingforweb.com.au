## Michael Chacko

Hello! I'm a computer science student from San Antonio, Texas. 
Feel free to look around my github and see some of thre projects I've been working on.

### My Projects

#### FRC Robotics
During high school, I was a member of FRC Team 3997, The Screaming Chickens.
This team has taught me so much about technology and gave me the chance to give back to my community through outreach events. 

(Pictures soon to come!)
